## Diversification Discount

- Discount on **diversified firms' valuations**, 
  - when benchmarked against focused firms' valuations (**Berger and Ofek 1995**)
  - **Custodio (2014)** uses q ratio to measure the discount
  - reasons proposed
    - opacity, inefficient resource allocation, etc

- The literature often assumes
  - diversified firms = multiple-segment (**MS**) firms
  - focused firms = single-segment (**SS**) firms



## Example segment-level and firm-level data

## q ratio vs. other valuation ratios

- Popular valuation ratios include  
  - previously discussed:
    - price to earnings (**P/E**)
    - price to operating cash flow (**P/OCF**)
  - price to book (**P/B**)
    - = Share price / BPS
    - where BPS = BV of common shareholders' equity per common share outstanding
  - **q ratio**
    - just like P/B, but concerns **total assets**, rather than common equity

  

## Valuation ratio for Comparison

- **q ratio** used by Custodio (2014)
    - q = Market Value to Book Value **of Total Assets**
- BV of TA is measured with Compustat's variable `at`
  - MV of TA is estimated with
    - `at - ceq + prcc_f*csho`,
  - where
    - `ceq` = BV of common equity
    - `prcc_f` = closing share price at fiscal year end
    - `csho` = number of common shares outstanding



## The comparision benchmark

- For any real MS firm, 
  - benchmark it against an equivalent **hypothetical MS firm** 
    - constructed by relating each segment of the real MS firm to a similar SS firm
- Then compare the real MS firm's q ratio (**q_Obs**) to the hypothetical MS firm's imputed q ratio (**q_Imp**) 
  - A _**valuation discount**_ exists if 
    - `q_Obs < q_Imp`
    - or, equivalently, `q_Obs/q_Imp < 1`



## Adjusting for goodwill 

- Custodio (2014) finds that 
  - MS firms have substantially **more acquisition activities** than SS firms
  - consequently, MS firms' BV of total assets contain significantly more goodwill
  
- Implication
  - MS firms' _**as-reported**_ q ratios (= MV to BV of TA) tend to be biased downward, compared to SS firm's
  
- Adjusting BV of total assets by **removing goodwill**
  - MS firms' _**adjusted**_ q ratios are no longer biased downward systematically
  - No more significant diversification discount
