# Diversifiction discount in a nutshell {#Diversifiction-discount-in-a-nutshell}



## This theme group concerns

- Discount on **diversified firms' valuations**, 
  - when benchmarked against focused firms' valuations (**Berger and Ofek 1995**)
- The literature often assumes
  - diversified firms = multiple-segment (**MS**) firms
  - focused firms = single-segment (**SS**) firms



## Valuation metric for Comparison

- Berger and Ofek (1995) use various asset/sales/EBIT multiples, incl.
  - the **q ratio** used by Custodio (2014)
    - q = Market Value to Book Value **of Total Assets**
- BV of TA is measured with Compustat's variable `at`
  - MV of TA is estimated with
    - `at - ceq + prcc_f*csho`,
  - where
    - `ceq` = BV of common equity
    - `prcc_f` = closing share price at fiscal year end
    - `csho` = number of common shares outstanding



## The comparision benchmark

- For any real MS firm, 
  - find **an equivalent 'synthetic' MS firm** as the comparison benchmark
- Then compare the real MS firm's actually observed q (**q_Obs**) to the q imputed for the synthetic MS firm (**q_Imp**) 
  - A _**valuation discount**_ exists if `q_Obs/q_Imp < 1`, which means
    - Excess value **xv** = `log(q_Obs/q_Imp)` **< 0**
  
  

## Imputed q ratio  

- Suppose the **real** MS firm in concern has two segments. 
  - Segment A in the `SIC = 2834` industry
  - Segment B in the `SIC = 2023` industry
    - The 4-digit code is the **Standard Industry Classification (SIC)** code
    
- To construct the **synthetic** MS firm as the comparison benchmark,
  - select a typical SS firm from the `SIC = 2834` industry;
  - select a typical SS firm from the `SIC = 2023` industry.
  - The synthetic MS firm is a firm formed with these **SS** firms, as though they were the synthetic MS firm's segments 

- By _typical_, it means the median (or the average) in Custodio (2014)  
  
  
  
## Different operation scale?  

- The operation scales of the SS firms are different from the segments' of the MS firm?
  - No worries 
- The q ratio is **scale-free**!
  - simply use the actually observed q ratios of the SS firms as the imputed q ratios for the segments of the MS firm
  - **weight** these q ratios by the **segment assets** (or **segment sales**) of the MS firm to obtain 
    - a weighted average q ratio as the _imputed q ratio_ for the MS firm (**q_Imp**) 
  


## Example segment-level and firm-level data

![Firm-level data](firmData.PNG)



# Elements of competent research {#Elements-of-competent-research}

- **Data**
- Research questions / Objectives
- Literature search
  - identify **key prior studies** to build upon 
    - e.g., Berger and Ofek (1995) and Campa and Kedia (2002)
- Analysis techniques (e.g., statistical models and tests)
  - borrow techniques from prior studies; **mix and match and modify** them
+ Implementation tool (e.g., R, Stata) 
+ Writing the project report 



## Data options

<!-- 
* ~~Questionnaires to collect first-handed~~ 
  - ~~often end up in a biased, small sample~~
-->  
- Commercial databases subscribed by Cass
  - a range of choices on [WRDS] (but only those with **[subscriptions]**)
    - currently include **Compustat, CRSP, Audit Analytics,** and several more
  - important to understand the meaning of the data variables and the structure of the databases
    - e.g., [`sale`] (consolidated _firm-level_ sales) vs. [`sales`] (_segment-level_ sales)
<!--     - e.g., [`ib`] vs. [`ibcom`]  -->

# Typical sections of project report {#Typical-sections-of-project-report}

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Literature Review
- Research Methodology
- Analysis and Results
- Conclusions



## Abstract

- A very brief summary of your research 
  - **highlighting the most essential** _elements, findings, and/or takeaways_
  - often around 250 words
    - up to about _half_ of the first page of the report
  


## Introduction

- describe the **objectives** of your research, **e.g.**, 
  - to _answer a research question_ that has not yet been fully addressed 
  - to _compare_ the findings of _different analysis approaches_ and assess their relative usefulness
- _motivate_ the objectives, i.e., explain **why** they are **interesting and important**
  - not just to you but to most other people (or certain important parties, e.g., investors, regulators, etc)
- give a quick **'executive summary'** of the research, including
  - _key results_
  - your _contributions_  
  (i.e., what you incrementally add to the world and _why it is worth knowing_ your addition)



## Literature Review

  - give an overview of the related literature, especially those 
    - **most directly related** to your project  
    (e.g., where you borrowed the analysis techniques)
  - **explain** how the reviewed studies are related to your project, 
    - or **how they are related to each other** in the literature
  

  
## Research Methodology

  - **explain** the sample construction, the analysis methods, and **how they fit with each other**
  - explain **why** the methodology can **serve the project objectives**  
  (e.g., answer your research questions)
  
  - FAQ: _How large should the sample be?_
      - The larger it is, the stronger your evidence is, the more general your conclusions are. 
      - Thus, _as large as it **could feasibly be**_ (**without** freezing your pc, making it too slow, etc)
        - _Note_: Only 1GB memory for RStudio Cloud's free-tier users


  
## Analysis and Results

  - report the **main analysis** in professionally-looking tables (and figures) 
    - see published research articles for what _**professionally-looking**_ means
  - **make sense of** the analysis results 
    - e.g., **explain why** certain results are **not as expected**, highlight certain expected results
  - report any **additional analysis**  (e.g., subsample analysis, robustness checks)
  

  
## Conclusions 

  - summarize the **key takeaways** most **consistent with the evidence** fom your analysis

# How to make a contribution {#How-to-make-a-contribution}

- **baseline:** replicate the diversification discount finding using **more recent data**
- additionally, in any of the following directions
  - consider [**new explanatory variables**](#New-explanatory-variables)
  - use [**alternative methodologies**](#Alternative-methodologies)
  - deepen the understanding for certain **interesting scenarios**
    - how about for a particular industry?
    - how about for a particular sample period/year?
    - what else?
  - in any case, need to **justify** your choice **convincingly!**
- any **insight** for practitioners?  



## New explanatory variables {#New-explanatory-variables}

- What explanations/variables have been **looked at?**
  - e.g., see all the [papers citing] Berger and Ofek (1995)
    - in particular, **Martin and Sayrak (2003), Wan et al (2011), and Ahuja and Novelli (2017)** in the [shared folder]
  - also, can the review paper on business groups by [Colli and Colpan (2014)] inspire anything related?

- What explanations/variables can you **newly propose?**
  - Can you find **quantifiable** measures for the new explanations?

- How about using more recent data to **re-examine old explanations with mixed findings** (so not hopeless)?

## Alternative methodologies {#Alternative-methodologies}

- For example, 
  - Custodio (2014) uses q ratio; Berger and Ofek (1995) also use other asset/sales/EBIT multiples
    - Are there other relevant **metrics** that have **not** been **considered before?**
    - **explain** why a proposed metric has an edge over previously used metrics!
  - Any other equally reasonable imputed q ratios to use **besides the industry median (or mean)** based on all single-segment firms of an industry?
    - How about confining to **SS firms matched by certain firm characteristics?**
      - (e.g., using the propensity score matching or other matching methodologies)

# Expectations {#Expectations}

- Very, very occasionally, there are reports in _low to mid 80's_ 

- But most reports fall in the **40's to low 70's** mark range
  - see [a report] in the shared folder that earned below 40

[a report]: https://cityuni-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/personal/andrew_yim_1_city_ac_uk/Documents/!%20Dissertations/FYP/Related%20studies%20(Diversification%20Discount)/Sample%20-%20unsatisfactory%20project%20report.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=lY8WeB



## Help me to give higher marks

- I always want to get higher marks 
  - but I need to let the **internal second marker** and the **external examiner** know the rationales for giving the marks.
- For example, 
  - I had given a low 80's to a student but the second marker _independently gave a lower mark_, leaving the final mark to be a high 70's.
  - The external examiner had questioned a case where I gave a low 40's 
    - She believed it _should be a fail_.
  


## Other things being equal, 

- **Which** of the reported tables below **deserve higher marks?**



## Cut-and-pasted software output
### (with distracting unnecessary details)

![](cut_and_paste.PNG){.class width=45%}



## Originally prepared tables
### (with three decimal places)

![](originally_prepared.PNG){.class width=85%}



## What can lead to low marks?

- For example, 
  - a report from a theme group on accounting restatements 
    - repeatedly misspelt 'restatement' as 're**in**statement'.
    - had a literature review that discusses **not a single article** with 'restatement' in the title; 
  - The quality of the report was in line with the student's low participation in the module: 
    - Never attended any of the 5 meetings, **not even the first one**
    - Submitted a very brief project proposal. I cautioned the student: 
      - "Many details need to be filled in before one can tell if the project is likely to be workable. Please do not underestimate the effort required to complete the project and the risks involved if it is **not taken seriously enough**."
    - Never submitted the milestone Methodology chapter; **no response** to submission reminders. 



## Time to spend on the project

- No less than what you'd spend on an **equivalent taught module** (full-year/one-term)
- Actually, should be more 
  - because of the **independent-learning** nature of the FYP/ARP
  - and the fact that you are an **inexperienced** student researcher



## Prior studies in the shared folder

- Must you **read them all?**
  - Short answer: No
  - Long answer: 
    - The materials are there to help a student get started.
    - One may even go beyond those materials, depending on your **aspiration and opportunity cost**
    - So everyone should _make her/his own judgment_
    
- In any circumstances, at least be very familiar with the details in 
  - **Berger and Ofek (1995)** and **Campa and Kedia (2002)**



## Barriers to success

- Bad time management
  - too much time on _trying to find the best objectives_ 
  - <fragment>**too little on actually working** out the analysis </fragment>
- Unrealistic / naive planning
  - wishfully plan to **spend only an afternoon to collect the data** for analysis
    - actually need substantially more time to learn where to find and how to use new variables
- **No justification to choices** made in the research process
  - significant results can't be guaranteed but how to make choices is fully controllable
- Insufficient attention to details
  - **all kinds of inconsistency** in the research process and the project report
  - eg,  research cited in the main text not included in reference list
    - **[Zotero]** can help you prevent such inconsistency

# What R can do for you {#What-R-can-do-for-you}



## This set of slides

- **Diver_Intro.rmd** (in the project folder shared on RStudio Cloud)
  - the source R markdown file used to render the reveal.js HTML slide presentation you are seeing
    - Need to have the `reveal.css` file in the project folder
    - must also include in the YAML header the following:
      - `output:` <br>
        <code>&nbsp;</code> `revealjs::revealjs_presentation`
  - reveal.js is a format allowing for vertically sequenced slides



## Clean data

- **Diver_CleanData.rmd**
  - do sanity checks and an initial clean-up on the raw data downloaded from WRDS 
  - apply various _filtering criteria_ to construct the sample for analysis
  - save the cleaned data as **segmentHist_cleanExample.rds** and **firm_cleanExample.rds**
    - files in R's native dataset format (.rds)



## Construct measures and run regressions

- **Diver_Measures.Rmd**
  - construct the required variables (e.g., q ratio, excess value)
  - write the final data as the file **firm_xvExample.csv**
  - run several regressions and present the results _side-by-side_ as columns in _a single table_



## The flow for data preparation and analysis 

- The codes were originally written for **replicating** some diversification discount results in Table III of Custodio (2014)

- Simple changes to the codes should let you **create the Excess Value variables** for measuring the divesification discount (in terms of q ratios) for a _different sample period_

- If you prefer another language (e.g., Stata), 
  - at least, the codes show you **the flow you can base on** to code in anonther language.
    - (though I don't use Stata and am not sure how Stata can accomplish the same tasks)



## Base R and R packages

- **Base R** refers to the capability of R _before loading any additional package_
- The demo codes also use the  R packages below:
  - {**magrittr**} allows piping together different operations into _one sequence_, like the different steps of a factory production line
  - {**tidyverse**} provides functions to work on a **dataframe** (if you like, a 'worksheet'), such as
    - filter(), select(), mutate(), left_join(), group_by(), etc
  - {**lubridate**} provides functions to work on _date-type_ variables, such as
    - ymd(), year(), month(), day()
  - {**stargazer**} allows the results of multiple regression models to be reported in a single table _neatly_



## RStudio installed in your pc
### (vs. RStudio Cloud)

- R and RStudio are free software; can be installed **locally** in your pc
  - Please google **[how to install R and RStudio in windows]** for related instructions
  
- RStudio's **free-tier** account
  - Limited to 1GB memory and only 15 hours of usage per month
  - Thus, will restrict the total number of years of data you can work with 
    - However, you can use the limited memory more efficiently 
      - by **first removing** from the downloaded data the segment-level data **variables that will not be used** at all
      - before you use RStudio Cloud to read in the .csv data file
