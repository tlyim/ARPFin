This code replicates some diversification discount results in Table III
of Custodio (2014) using data for 1990-1991.

She constructs her sample based on the following criteria:

* firms with missing segment SIC codes are excluded

* firms must *NOT* have any [*business* segment] in the 
  - financial sector (SIC codes 6000 to 6999), 
  - agriculture (SIC code lower than 1000), 
  - government (SIC 9000), or 
  - other noneconomic activities (SIC 8600 and 8800)

In addition,  

* firms for unclassified services (SIC 8900) are excluded; 
  
* firm sales greater than $20 million; 

* firms for which the [sum of business segment sales or assets] deviates from the [firmâ€™s total sales or assets] by [more than 5%] are also excluded

Commands and functions used in the next code chunk: 

'%>%' is used to chain a series of operations together in one go (a function by package {magrittr})
 You can think of the chained operations as the different steps in a factory production line

'sics_my' below is my version of the segment SIC code,
  currently defined as sics_my = sics1 (the first segment SIC code provided by Compustat)
Coding in terms of sics_my allows the flexibility of changing the assignment of sics_my later
For example, I can simply reassign sics_my = sics2 (Compustat's second segment SIC code)
  without changing all the code lines involving sics_my

'rm_flag' below sets the flag for later removing certain inappropriate observations
  It is only indicating what is to be removed, not immediately removing the observation
 Certain observations need to be reomoved because they do not fit the sample construction criteria

'ifelse(Condition, Value_T, Value_F)' checks
  whether the Condition is true (T) or false (F) for every item in a column of a dataframe
  (or, if you like, a worksheet),
  then assign Value_T if the condition is true and Value_F if false

'mutate(Variable = Value)' assigns a value to a column variable of a dataframe

'=>' means greater than or equal to ('==' means equal to, '<=' means less than or equal to)

'group_by(Var1, Var2, Var3)' groups the rows of a dataframe according to
  each unique combination of the variables Var1, Var2, and Var3,
  then let the actions in the code lines thereafter to apply the actions group by group individually,
  eg, this would be convenient for computing the subtotals of those groups,
  rather than a single overall for all the rows of the dataframe.
  
'gvkey' is Compustat's unique company identifier for each firm in the database (Note: the variable gvkey from the CRSP-Compustat Merged Fundamental Annual database was originally in captial letters, ie, GVKEY. It must be converted into lower case before it can be used as the key for merging the firm-level Fundamental Annual data with the segment-level Historical Segments data)

'datadate' is Compustat's variable for the date of the data in concern. 

'ungroup()' ends the group operations and returns to the normal mode

'is.na(Variable)' checks whether T or F that the Variable has no value (ie, indicated as NA)

'|' means the OR of two conditions ('&' means the AND of two conditions)

'!' placed in front of a logical variable (taking TRUE or FALSE as value) means negation, ie,
 turning TRUE to FALSE, or FALSE to TRUE
 thus, '!rm_flag' stands for the condition that !rm_flag is TRUE, which means rm_flag is FALSE

'filter(Condition)' filters the dataframe to keep only the rows in the dataframe meeting the Condition
  So 'filter(!rm_flag)' keeps only the rows where the flag rm_flag = FALSE

'n()' gets the total count of the rows in a group;
  eg, used to determine how many segments a firm has (after grouping segment records by each firm)

'sum(Variable)' gets the total sum of the values in the Variable column of a group
  eg, used to determine the sum of the segment sales of a firm
  For financial reporting reasons, this sum can deviate from the consolidated total sales of the firm
  Diversification research often requires excluding obs. with large deviations in firm & segment sales

ias refers to the Compustat variable 'Identifiable Assets - Segment'
see https://wrds-web.wharton.upenn.edu/wrds/support/Data/_001Manuals%20and%20Overviews/_001Compustat/_001North%20America%20-%20Global%20-%20Bank/_000dataguide/ias.cfm

'arrange(Var1, Var2, Var3)' sorts the dataframe in ascending order by the variables Var1, Var2, Var3
 Use 'desc(Variable)' to indicate that this Variable is to be sorted by descending order

Anything embraced by opening " and closeing " is a text string
'as.integer("8")' will convert the text string "8" into a variable of the integer type with a value 8
'as.integer(TRUE)' will convert the logical value TRUE to integer 1 (FALSE will be converted to  0)

```


Commands and functions used in the next code chunk: 

'paste0(TextString1, TextString2)' combines the texts in the two text string variables into one single text string

'Dataframe_L %>% select(Var1, Var2, Var3)', or equivalently 'select(Dataframe_L, Var1, Var2, Var3)', 
  selects to keep only the Var1, Var2, Var3 columns of the dataframe
  'select(Var1, everything())' moves Var1 to the beginning column of the dataframe and 
  still keeps everything else in the dataframe

'Dataframe_L %>% left_join(Dataframe_R, by = c("Var1", "Var2"))' merges all the variable columns in Dataframe_R to Dataframe_L by the merging key variables Var1 and Var2, keeping all the rows in Dataframe_L (and potential expanding the rows if the rows between the two dataframes do not match uniquely). 

'ymd(VariablewithValueLikeADate)' turns a text string or integer variable with a value that looks like a date into R's date format, eg, 19901231 as an integer into 1990-12-31, a value of the date type in R. 

'tolower(names(Dataframe_L))' converts all the column variable names of the dataframe to lower case

'mutate_at(vars(Var1, Var2, Var3), ~ ifelse(is.na(.x), 0, .x))' is equivalent to 
  'mutate(Var1 =  ifelse(is.na(Var1), 0, Var1))' and similarly for Var2 and Var3 as well. 
  'mutate(Var1 =  ifelse(is.na(Var1), 0, Var1))' means if Var1 is empty (ie, is.na(Var1) = TRUE), 
  then assign the value 0 to Var1; otherwise, keeps Var1's original value as it is.
  The above is done on certain variables. For example, Compustat's goodwill variabe (gdwl) often has missing values for many firms. Using these missing values as they are would mean automatically excluding these firms from the sample used for regression analysis. Often the missing values reflect the reality that the firms have not been involved in any business combinations and thus no goodwill has been created as a result. In other words, the goodwill these firms have is zero. This is why when there is a good reason, some missing-value variables may be converted into a 0 value to keep the observations for regression analysis.

To apply the filtering criterion below, segment-level data are merged into firm-level data to provide the sums of segment sales and segment assets (saleSUM and iaSUM): 

  * firms for which the [sum of business segment sales or assets] deviates from the [firmâ€™s total sales or assets] by [more than 5%] are also excluded

Applying the criterion removes the firms that involve larger than acceptable deviations between firm and segment sales or assets, excluding these problematic cases from the sample.
